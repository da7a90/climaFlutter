Flutter Weather app with city choice and automatic city image

the app gives you your current location's weather on the first load.
you can see another city's temperature when you click the top right button.
you can also add cities to a list to see their current temperature and when clicked you will get weather details for that ciy 
like humidity, pressure....
I used the openweathermap API for the weather data and the teleport API for the cities images.
